If, for some reason, you wanted to follow what is going on in my brain whist I'm doing this:
you're in the right place.

## Do the dumb thing 1st

I reckon we'll be going through low-hundreds of numbers.
So we're talking ~1e5 pairs and ~1e7 triplets.
In the grand scheme of things thats not _too_ much work
and I reckon we'll be through the triplets in well sub-second.

So lets do the dumb thing 1st and not worry about performance
for now

> Premature optimization is the root of all evil

and all that.
